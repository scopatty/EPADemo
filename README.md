# Demo Application

To implement the "Secure and Scalable E-commerce Website Deployment" project using Microsoft Azure, you'll follow a multi-layered, DevOps-focused cloud architecture approach. Here's a step-by-step guide covering:
	• Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
	• CI/CD
	• Security
	• Scalability
	• High Availability

 1. Architecture Overview in Azure

User -> Azure Front Door / Application Gateway
      -> Azure App Service / AKS (Web Frontend)
      -> Azure SQL / Cosmos DB / Blob Storage (Data Layer)
      -> Azure Functions / Logic Apps (Backend Logic)
      -> Azure Monitor / Application Insights (Monitoring)

2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

Stack: 
	• Azure App Service Plan + Web App
	• Azure SQL or Cosmos DB
	• Azure Key Vault
	• Azure Application Gateway / Azure Front Door

3. CI/CD Pipeline
Use Azure DevOps Pipelines or GitHub Actions.
Steps:
	1. Source Control: GitHub or Azure Repos
	2. CI:
		○ Build and test application (Node.js/Python/Java/.NET)
		○ Dockerize (if using containers)
	3. CD:
		○ Deploy infrastructure (IaC)
		○ Deploy app to Azure App Service or AKS
